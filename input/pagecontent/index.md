This guide describes how to implement solutions compliant with the data standards created by the Structured Pathology project.

There are 2 main parts of the architecture

* Creating the Structured Pathology request
* Generating the Structured report

Initially, it was envisaged that all the parts of this solution would be FHIR compliant but it became evident that this was not achievable in the current environment, so the overall solution now includes HL7 version 2 messaging as shown in the following diagram

### Making the request
>>> compliant with SDC




### Generating the report

There are 3 primary stages

* The report is generated by the Lab as an HL7 Version 2 ORU message
* The v2 message is transformed into FHIR resources
* The FHIR resources are saved into the FHIR datastore

__Note that there is a separate path by which the report is transmtted to the requestor. This flow has
a copy of the report__
